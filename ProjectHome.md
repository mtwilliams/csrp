## Project Description ##

This project is a minimal C implementation of the Secure Remote Password protocol (http://srp.stanford.edu/). It is intended for direct inclusion by utilizing programs and it's only dependency is OpenSSL.

## Brief Description of SRP ##

SRP is a cryptographically strong authentication
protocol for password-based, mutual authentication over an insecure
network connection.

Unlike other common challenge-response autentication protocols, such
as Kereros and SSL, SRP does not rely on an external infrastructure
of trusted key servers or certificate management. Instead, SRP server
applications use verification keys derived from each user's password
to determine the authenticity of a network connection.

SRP provides mutual-authentication in that successful authentication
requires both sides of the connection to have knowledge of the
user's password. If the client side lacks the user's password or the
server side lacks the proper verification key, the authentication will
fail.

Unlike SSL, SRP does not directly encrypt all data flowing through
the authenticated connection. However, successful authentication does
result in a cryptographically strong shared key that can be used
for symmetric-key encryption.

This library serves as the basis for a compatible Python module called
[pysrp](http://code.google.com/p/pysrp). The [pysrp](http://code.google.com/p/pysrp) project
contains complete, user-friendly API documentation as well as a comprehensive overview
of the SRP protocol. As the APIs are virtually identical, the [pysrp](http://code.google.com/p/pysrp) documentation
is an excellent reference for understanding this library.
